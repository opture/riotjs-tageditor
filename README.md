# Riotjs TagEditor
Editing environment intended for prototyping, creating and sharing <a href="http://muut.com/riotjs">riotjs</a> based tags.
At the moment it can be used to create single standalone components, with the vision to create nested tags that can represent a complete application.
It provides editors for the tag definition, styling of the tag and a mock for manually testing of the component.

The idea to make this is mainly because I want to streamline my own development cycles. I want to easily keep track of my components and I want to be able to reuse them easily. So at the moment I paste my own tags into this and I develop applications using this. But at the moment I only copy and paste the tags from here into my projects. The idea is to create a build environment that minifies and autoprefixes the source. 

#Description
The intention is to create an easy to use tag development tool.
